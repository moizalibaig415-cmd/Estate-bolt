        <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-medium mb-6">How we started</h2>
        <div className="space-y-5 font-body text-base text-ink/80 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Sahil &amp; Saaya opened in 2014 on a single premise: that property
            transactions in Karachi needed an agency that knew the difference
            between a building that looks good and a building that is sound. Aisha
            Khan, our founding partner, had spent seven years at a commercial real
            estate firm in Dubai and returned to Karachi frustrated by how often
            buyers discovered title disputes, utility problems, or structural
            defects only after signing the bayana.
          </p>
          <p>
            We started with one desk in a shared office on Sunset Boulevard and a
            notebook of contacts — electricians, plumbers, society transfer clerks,
            and the DHA and Clifton Cantonment Board offices. The first year we
            sold four houses and managed six rentals. By 2019 we had four agents,
            each handling a different part of the city, and a management portfolio
            of thirty properties for overseas owners.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not list every property we are offered. If the title documentation
            is incomplete — missing fard, pending inteqal, disputed mutation — we
            will not take the listing. If the asking price is more than 15% above
            comparable sales in the same block, we will tell the seller to adjust
            or find another agent. This means we carry fewer properties than the
            larger agencies, and we are comfortable with that.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are registered with the Sindh Real Estate Agents Association under
            license {agency.license} and carry professional indemnity insurance
            through EFU General. Our office is at {agency.address.line1},{' '}
            {agency.address.line2}.
